# Leveraging Transfer Learning of Whisper Transformers for transcribing African-Accented Speech

![Alt Text](africa_diversity.gif)

Research has shown that the adoption of audio transcription in the South African contact centres is low due to international transcription services providing poor accuracy as most of the global transcription services in the market currently caters best for unaccented English. Africa has the highest linguistic diversity in the world and accounts for one third of the total languages spoken across the world, which are currently underserved, underrepresented and have limited access for transcription. South Africa has 11 official languages and a multilingual population that is fluent in at least two of these languages we believe that the 4th industrial revolution must reflect Africaâ€™s culture and diversity.

This task aims to assess the effectiveness of transfer learning using Whisper Transformers in transcribing African-accented English speech.
We utilize the Afrispeech dataset which is a pre-existing African-accented English data set that was designed to support Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) research for under-resourced languages in Africa. This approach effectively captures the complexities, diverse linguistic contexts, and subtle nuances of the varying accents, resulting in more precise transcriptions. This study emphasizes the significance of taking the diversity of accents into account in Automatic Speech Recognition systems and provides valuable insights for the development of inclusive and precise language technologies specifically tailored for African languages.
