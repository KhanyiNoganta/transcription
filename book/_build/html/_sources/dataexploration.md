## Audio Waveform

The audio waveform offers a visual depiction of the temporal characteristics of sound waves. In the context of African-accented speech, each sample exhibited discernible patterns and waveform variations. This statement reflects the distinctive phonetic and prosodic characteristics typically associated with African accents. It is noteworthy that each waveform in the corpora exhibited distinct and unique characteristics, thereby demonstrating distinctive shifts in pitch and tonal patterns.


## Mel Spectogram

A Mel spectrogram is a graphical representation that depicts the temporal evolution of the frequency components present in an audio signal. When conducting an analysis of the Mel spectrogram of African-accented English and French speech, it is evident that there are notable variations in the accents. The potential cause of this phenomenon can be attributed to variations in vowel formants, distinct pitch patterns, or disparities in energy allocation across various frequency bands. These characteristics contribute to the uniqueness and scarcity of features related to the same behavior exhibited in African accents. This further illustrates the challenges associated with perceiving and comprehending African accents through speech.

## Sentences

The sentence shown is from the audio transcripts that depict the temporal development of speech, wherein each line corresponds to a sentence or utterance. Upon visualizing the transcripts pertaining to African-accented speech, it becomes evident that there may exist discernible trends or patterns that arise when two distinct accented speakers articulate an identical sentence. The potential influence on this phenomenon could stem from cadence, tempo, or melodic patterns that are distinctive in African-accented languages. Furthermore, there may be discernible prominent prosodic characteristics, including stress patterns at the phrase level or accentuation of specific words.


## Signal to noise ratio

Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) plots depict the relative proportions of the intended speech signal and ambient background noise. Within the framework of African-accented speech, these plots were employed to evaluate the extent of ambient noise within the datasets and their potential ramifications in speech recognition or transcription. A signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 0 dB indicates that the power of the signal is equivalent to that of the noise, indicating that the desired signal can only be barely distinguished from the background noise. As the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) increases, the relative prominence of the signal in relation to noise is enhanced, leading to improved signal quality and intelligibility. A signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 100 dB signifies a substantial disparity between the strength of the desired signal and the accompanying noise. This discrepancy indicates exceptional audio
quality and minimal interference, as the desired signal significantly surpasses the background noise in magnitude. Based on the depicted samples, it is evident that the majority of audio exhibits satisfactory quality. The aforementioned criterion holds significant importance because of its potential impact on the efficacy of automatic speech recognition systems, particularly within the context of this study, which focuses on the distinctive characteristics and patterns of African-accented speech.
